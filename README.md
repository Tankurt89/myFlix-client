my-Flix-client is where the front end of myflix api is going to be built.

This project will be using React along with src files of .jsx, .scss.

Initial steps of the project started on 5/31/23 and pushed to github.

First large update to the app was pushed on 6/2/23.
This update added in a components folder with sub folders for main-view, movie-card, and movie-view.
Withing each folder new .jsx files were created and updated.
movie-card.jsx was added to allow a movie title, from main-view, to be clicked on. Upon clicking the title the movie-view.jsx takes over and displays information about the movie including: description, genre, director. It also has a back button that can be clicked to take you back to the main-view and select a different movie.
